# GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample2WithEclipseIDE
This builds on top of the previous example GEANT4-BareBonesExampleWithEclipseIDE by adding the three essential but minimal classes: DetectorConstruction, PhysicsList, PrimaryGeneratorAction.

(To prevent any possible naming confusion, think of the previous example name "GEANT4-BareBonesExampleWithEclipseIDE" as synonymous with "GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample1WithEclipseIDE"; that's why this present example is called "GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample2WithEclipseIDE".)
