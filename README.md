# GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample2WithEclipseIDE
This builds on top of the previous example GEANT4-BareBonesExampleWithEclipseIDE by adding the three essential but minimal classes: DetectorConstruction, PhysicsList, PrimaryGeneratorAction.

The unresolved inclusions seem to be false warnings issued by Eclipse; they can be safely ignored. Excuse also some code  indenting issues in MyDetectorConstruction.cc whilst pushing from Eclipse to GitHub and my file suffix inconsistency (.cpp and .cc).

(To prevent any possible naming confusion, think of the previous example name "GEANT4-BareBonesExampleWithEclipseIDE" as synonymous with "GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample1WithEclipseIDE"; that's why this present example is called "GEANT4-MinimalWorkingExample2WithEclipseIDE".)
